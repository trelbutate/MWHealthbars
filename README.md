A dumb little mod for Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005) that displays health bars above police cars, showing you how close they are to being destroyed.  
Note that this mod doesn't change the gameplay in any way, it merely visualizes the damage information the game uses already.

## Installation

To install this you need:

* **v1.3** of the game
* An ASI loader, or a mod that uses an ASI loader, for example:
    * [Widescreen Fix](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack/releases/tag/nfsmw)
    * [NFSMW Extra Options](https://github.com/ExOptsTeam/NFSMWExOpts)
    * [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader)

When you have installed the ASI loader, download `healthbars.asi` and copy it into the `scripts` folder in the game directory.
